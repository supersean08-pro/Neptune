# A1. Identifying and Defining

## Problem Statement and Feasibility Assessment

This project aims to provide an engaging, educational web application that allows students and science enthusiasts to explore the planet Neptune interactively. The need arises from the lack of beginner-friendly, immersive digital tools for learning planetary science beyond static websites or textbooks. By transforming the original console-based Python program into a web app using Flask, HTML, CSS, Jinja, and JavaScript, the project leverages modern web technologies to make space science more accessible and enjoyable.

**Feasibility Assessment:**
- **Scheduling Feasibility:** The outlined roadmap breaks the project into manageable phases (feature development, testing, polish, web conversion, packaging), each with clear tasks. The conversion to Flask is structured in beginner-friendly steps. With a 10-week timeline, each phase can be completed in 1â€“2 weeks, allowing time for testing and polish.
- **Resource Feasibility:**
  - **Tools:** All required tools are free and widely available: Flask (web framework), Python (programming language), SQLite (optional for persistence), GitHub (version control), and PythonAnywhere (for deployment).
  - **Skills:** The project is designed to be approachable for beginners, with clear documentation and incremental steps.
  - **Hardware:** Runs on any computer capable of running Python and a web browser.

## Requirements List and Technical Specifications

### Functional Requirements (MVP)
- Users can:
  - View Neptune from different perspectives (surface, atmosphere, moon, orbit)
  - Calculate their weight on Neptune
  - Learn what it would feel like to stand on Neptune
  - Navigate via a main menu (web navigation)
- Each feature is accessible through a web interface (Flask routes and HTML pages)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Beginner-friendly, readable code (well-commented, modular)
- Responsive, visually appealing UI (basic CSS, optional enhancements)
- Secure input handling (no SQL injection, input validation)
- Runs locally and can be deployed to a free hosting service

### Technical Specifications
- **Backend:** Python 3.x with Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2 templates, JavaScript (optional for effects)
- **Data Structures:**
  - For MVP, no persistent data is required (all features are stateless)
  - If extended, can use SQLite for storing user data or quiz scores
- **Boundaries:**
  - Web application only (desktop/laptop browser)
  - No mobile app or native desktop app planned
  - No user registration or login for MVP (can be added as an extension)
