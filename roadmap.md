## 💻 Phase 3: Core Feature Development

### ✅ Goal:
Build all major features of the MVP.

### 🔹 Tasks:
1. **User Interface (Console)**
 - [x] Create a main menu system with options (1–4).
 - [x] Allow user to input choices and loop until exit.

2. **View Descriptions**
 - [x] Provide 4 viewing options:
   - Surface of Neptune
   - Upper atmosphere
   - Moon Triton
   - Orbital view
 - [x] Write creative but scientifically grounded text descriptions.
 - [x] Display response based on selection.

3. **Weight Calculator**
 - [x] Ask for user’s mass (kg).
 - [x] Calculate weight using `W = M × G` (G = 11.15 m/s²).
 - [x] Display result with explanation of formula.

4. **Environmental Feelings Simulation**
 - [x] Describe what it would feel like on Neptune.
 - [x] Use slow printed text for immersive effect.
 - [x] Include temperature, pressure, and wind details.

## 🧪 Phase 4: Testing & Debugging

### ✅ Goal:
Ensure the program works smoothly and handles user inputs well.

### 🔹 Tasks:
- [x] Test all features one by one.
- [x] Check invalid inputs (e.g. letters instead of numbers).
- [x] Confirm program exits correctly and loops logically.
- [x] Adjust formatting for clarity and readability.

## ✨ Phase 5: Polish & Optional Features

### ✅ Goal:
Improve user experience and add extras if time allows.

### 🔹 Optional Tasks:
- [ ] Add ASCII art for Neptune or space theme.
- [ ] Add fun Neptune trivia.
- [ ] Add a quiz feature ("How much do you know about Neptune?").
- [ ] Expand weight calculator to include other planets.
- [ ] Use `tkinter` to build a basic graphical interface.
- [ ] Add sound using `playsound` for immersion.
- [ ] Display data sources or references at the end.

## 📦 Phase 6: Packaging & Sharing

### ✅ Goal:
Prepare the project for presentation, submission, or sharing.

### 🔹 Tasks:
- [ ] Write a clean `README.md` explaining:
- Project overview
- How to run it
- Features
- Credits
- [ ] Save as a `.zip` or publish to GitHub.
- [ ] Include `roadmap.md` and `main.py` in project folder.
- [ ] Test the project on another device (if possible).

## 🌐 Phase 7: Web App Conversion (Flask, HTML, CSS, Jinja, JS)

### ✅ Goal:
Transform the console-based Neptune program into a beginner-friendly web app using Flask and web technologies.

### 🔹 Steps & Outline:
1. **Set Up Flask Project**
   - Install Flask and create a new project structure
   - Set up basic Flask app and run a "Hello, world!" page
2. **Convert Features to Flask Routes**
   - Create routes for main menu, view descriptions, weight calculator, and Neptune feeling
   - Move logic from Python functions to route handlers
3. **Create HTML Templates (Jinja)**
   - Design simple, clean HTML pages for each feature
   - Use Jinja templating for dynamic content (user input, results)
4. **Add CSS Styling**
   - Style pages for readability and a space/Neptune theme
   - Keep CSS simple and well-commented
5. **Add JavaScript (Optional for Interactivity)**
   - Use JS for small enhancements (e.g., typewriter effect, input validation)
6. **Test All Features**
   - Ensure all user flows work as expected in the browser
7. **Document How to Run the Web App**
   - Update README with web app instructions

### 🔹 Tasks:
- [ ] Install Flask and set up virtual environment
- [ ] Create `app.py` with Flask routes
- [ ] Build HTML templates for each feature using Jinja
- [ ] Migrate Python logic to Flask views
- [ ] Add CSS for basic styling
- [ ] (Optional) Add JavaScript for effects/interactivity
- [ ] Test the app in the browser
- [ ] Update README with web app instructions

## 🏁 Final Goal

A working, polished Python program that allows users to:
- Choose how they want to explore Neptune
- Learn what it would feel like
- Calculate their weight on Neptune
- Get immersed in space science with simplicity
