        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> 1.024 × 10<sup>26</sup> kg (17.15 Earths)
            <p></p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">Having a large density for a gas giant, its actually more massive than Uranus, which is larger than Neptune, this is because Uranus' density is lower than Neptune's, and especially the fact, Neptune, is the densest Gas giant in the Solar System</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Equatorial Diameter:</strong> 49,244 km
        <li><strong>Mean Radius:</strong> 24,622 km
            <p></p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">For Gas giants, it is wise to put in its diameter for its equator, its polar diameter would be different compared to its equator, this shows with the 6th planet from the sun, Saturn, this goes with Jupiter aswell but is not as noticeable</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Distance from Sun:</strong> 4.495 billion km (30.07 AU)

        <li><strong>Number of Moons:</strong> 16 (As Of: 25.6.2025)
            <p></p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">Many of Neptunes moons were discovered as soon as Voyager 2, As of 25th of June, is the only spacecraft to have flown by Neptune, including Uranus, Only a few moons then, had been discovered by Hubble.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1em;">Triton</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">Triton, is the largest moon in Neptune's System, and is its only major moon, Triton was thought to be a Dwarf Planet similar to Pluto, but had been captured by Neptune Into Its Retrograde Orbit it now has today, which explains this, but because it has a retrograde orbit, it is thought that in 3.6 Billion Years time, because of friction of its retrograde orbit, That it might fall into neptune, or be turned into a ring system, greater than Saturn's. It is also Geologically Active, this is rare among Solar System Bodies, and has its own tenuis atmosphere that was sufficient enough to have clouds.</p>
            </li>
        <li><strong>Ring System:</strong> Yes, faint and dark rings
            <p></p>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Discovered by:</strong> Johann Galle & Urbain Le Verrier
        <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> September 23, 1846
